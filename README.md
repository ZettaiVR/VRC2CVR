# VRC2CVR
VRC2CVR is a VRCSDK2 replacement that help converting existing VRC avatars to ChilloutVR (CVR).

It replaces the VRC SDK, so if you have it in your project you should remove it.

To install it just import the unitypackage.

Features:
* Converts the VRC Avatar Descriptor to a CVR Avatar script and carries over viewpoint and viseme settings
* Calculates a voice position either from a viseme or from the viewpoint
* Converts the VRC Animator Override Controller to the CVR one by matching the common animations (movement, hand poses, and emotes)
* Removes the VRC Avatar Descriptor with a press of a button

All VRC code and assets have been removed or replaced.

**Use at you own risk, and make a backup before converting.**
